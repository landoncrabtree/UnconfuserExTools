A nice tutorial about array initializers:

For ConfuserEx we should start analyzes from module constructor:
<Module>.cctor
- from there all protection are called!
1. First method called is the AntiTamper protection:
this decrypt methods!
Take a look at:
C:\ConfuserEx-master\Confuser.Runtime\AntiTamper.Normal.cs
ConfuserExMethodsDecryptor will handle this protection.
After that we simply nop that call from <Module>.cctor!
2. Second method called contains something like this:
        case 0x1f:
            assembly_0 = Assembly.Load(smethod_29(buffer));
            AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += new ResolveEventHandler(<Module>.smethod_37);
this is the Resource protection,
take a look at C:\ConfuserEx-master\Confuser.Runtime\Resource.cs
So you must dump the assembly which contains resources
and add them to assembly using ResourceManager
3. Third method called contains something like this:
byte_0 = smethod_29(buffer);
so it bassically calls other method which returns
a byte array and has as parameter a byte array!
byte_0 is defined as:
internal static byte[] byte_0;
This is the constant protection, take a look at:
C:\ConfuserEx-master\Confuser.Runtime\Constant.cs
This also include the string decryption!
4. Fourth method called include:
Marshal.GetHINSTANCE(module_0);
if (smethod_26(smethod_25(module), 0) != '<')
...
and also a lot of VirtualProtect api call!
This is the antidump protection, take a look at:
C:\ConfuserEx-master\Confuser.Runtime\AntiDump.cs
5. Fifth method called (the last one) contains
an parameterized thread:
thread = smethod_8(new ParameterizedThreadStart(<Module>.smethod_1));
This is the antidebug protection, take a look at:
C:\ConfuserEx-master\Confuser.Runtime\AntiDebug.Safe.cs

So what we do?
We first decrypt method body using ConfuserExMethodsDecryptor!
We get ride of PE protection using ConfuserExFixer.
We deobfuscate the assembly using de4dot.
We nop almost all calls from module constructor
EXCEPT constant protection call!

When we run the program we get an OutOfMemoryException somewhere inside
constant protection method!

internal static void smethod_30()
{
    uint num = 0x30;
    uint[] numArray = new uint[] { 
        0x24b5823f, 0xe24c501f, 0x221a64c7, 0xaa565db7, 0xdcb5c15e, 0x5faa4a99, 0xedeff02f, 0xb4c60649, 0x301b00f8, 0x17e073b4, 0x4a14c2fe, 0x9a85e3aa, 0xcc0421a0, 0x84d25b96, 0x784d134, 0xf86368f9, 
        0xd0dc9f59, 0x4bef1ebe, 0x1b537985, 0x41132bb0, 0xb07f6f36, 0x7c353e75, 0xcf5ce94c, 0x9b0a1e07, 0x46175c4b, 0x35de0d5e, 0x616ae0c9, 0x28ad1516, 0xff8b5f66, 0x322c8ccb, 0x7392bdee, 0x57f32fe5, 
        0xbcce9496, 0x142dba75, 0x1dd635c6, 0xd7ccfda9, 0x4435110e, 0x58a02a49, 0xe9efe061, 0xb14e7645, 0xa813f13e, 0x13dca3e4, 0x7983033c, 0x968423fa, 0xcb7291a0, 0x9f46bb80, 0x87e0a2a4, 0xf443e909
     };
...
byte_0 = smethod_29(buffer);

In C:\ConfuserEx-master\Confuser.Runtime\Constant.cs
		private static void Initialize() {
			var l = (uint)Mutation.KeyI0;
			uint[] q = Mutation.Placeholder(new uint[Mutation.KeyI0]);
...
			b = Lzma.Decompress(o);

So all we have to do is getting right contents of byte_0
and replace smethod_30 method to simply set that contents!
We get right contents by simply calling constant protection method!
ConfuserExConstant source attached!
Game over!
